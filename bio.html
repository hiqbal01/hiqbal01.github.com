Hello! My name is Haris Iqbal and I am from Islamabad, the capital city of 
Pakistan. I have come to the United States for my Undergraduate Education, 
and am currently pursuing a degree in Electrical Engineering, with a second 
major in Economics, at Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts, in the 
suburbs of Boston.

My interests include music, books, and food. One of my favorite books is The 
Kite Runner, especially because of the poignant plot, and the beautiful writing.
I love going out into the city, and trying out new places with different 
cuisines. My favortie genres in terms of music are house, techno and trance.
